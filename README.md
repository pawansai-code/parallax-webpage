# parallax-webpage

This is a simple Parallax Scrolling Webpage built using only HTML and CSS. The webpage highlights the beauty, culture, and locations of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, Ooty, Kanyakumari, and Jallikattu. Background images scroll at a different speed compared to the foreground content, creating a smooth parallax effect across the page.

No frameworks or JavaScript were used â€” it is entirely frontend and beginner-friendly.
